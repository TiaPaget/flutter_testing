# flutter_testing

This application is for testing things in Flutter and learning as I go.

# Decider Application
This application will be used by multiple users on a single device. Each user will tap on the screen once at the location nearest to them. Each tap will display as a small circle on the screen (each with a different random colour). A central "Decide" button will be pressed where each circle (user) is greyed out.
At random colour will cycle between different circles, indicating that it may be chosen. After a given number of cycles (Each circle highlighted twice), the final circle will stay coloured. The screen will fade to this colour and state that this user has been chosen.
The user can now go back to restart the process.
